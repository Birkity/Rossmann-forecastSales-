Rossmann Pharmaceuticals - Sales Forecasting Project
Overview
This project aims to build an end-to-end sales forecasting solution for Rossmann Pharmaceuticals. 
The objective is to predict sales six weeks ahead for different stores across multiple cities.
The analysis focuses on various factors affecting sales such as promotions, 
holidays, seasonal trends, store assortment types, and competitor proximity.

The repository includes:

Data exploration and preprocessing.
Feature engineering and handling missing values.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights into store performance.
Visualizations to compare and interpret trends in sales, promotions, customer behavior, and other key factors.
A roadmap to forecast sales in later stages using machine learning models.

This project is an attempt to forecast sales for Rossmann Pharmaceuticals using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The dataset consists of store-level sales data and associated features such as promotions, holidays, and competition.

Due to resource limitations (hardware constraints), this project focuses on Random Forest Regressor as a baseline model while laying the groundwork for an LSTM model for time series forecasting. Unfortunately, the deep learning model couldn't be fully trained due to the high computational demands.

The analysis was performed in two stages:

Preprocessing and Feature Engineering
Random Forest Modeling
LSTM Preparation (incomplete due to hardware constraints)
